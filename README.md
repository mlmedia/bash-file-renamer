#File renamer (shell)#
Shell script to rename files recursively through directories

##Usage/Installation##
1. Download / grab the renamer.sh file and place it anywhere on your computer
2. Run the following script to rename all files in a directory:

```bash
sh rename.sh PATH/TO/SOURCE/FILE/DIR/ PATH/TO/DESTINATION
```

##Example###
Running the following script on the sample_files/ directory found in this application would be:

```bash
sh rename.sh ./sample_files ./backup
```

##Learn / Adopt / Fork##
I try to use clear commenting to explain my code, so if you'd like to learn more, simply view the "renamer.sh" file.

Also, feel free to adopt and adapt to make it your own.  If you like, fork it and send over a pull request.  Add or solve existing issues.  It is open-source, after all.
